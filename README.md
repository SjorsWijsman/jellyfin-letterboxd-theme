# jellyfin-letterboxd-theme

As a Letterboxd junkie I wanted a Jellyfin theme to fit the Letterboxd aesthetic. This theme uses the [Scyfin](https://github.com/loof2736/scyfin/blob/main/LICENSE) theme by loof2736 as a base.

> [!NOTE]
> This theme was made just for fun and has not been extensively tested, so be wary that there might be bugs, ugly stuff, etc. :)
> Feel free to open up an issue if you think something can be improved or whatever.
